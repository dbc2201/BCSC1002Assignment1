#### Assignment 1 : Library Book Inventory System

###### Author: [Divyansh Bhardwaj](https://github.com/dbc2201)



##### Problem Statement

Every good university/college has a well-stocked library for the students. The students get access to a wide variety of
 literature on topics/subjects that are crucial for their personal as well as professional development. But as the 
 number of students using the library increases, the task of keeping records get very difficult. In this assignment, we 
 are going to simulate that task by writing a piece of software.



Here are the details of the classes that need to be implemented:

1. a `Book` class, to define what is a book and its details.
2. a `Student` class, to define what is a student and its details.
3. a `Library` class, to define a collection of `Book`s.
4. a `FrontDesk` class, to allow a `Student` to interact with the `Library`.



Here is a sample of the `FrontDesk` class' output.

```
-=-=--=-=-"Welcome To The Front Desk"-=-=--=-=-
How may I help you today?
1. Issue a new book for me.
2. Return a previously issued book for me.
3. Show me all my issues books.
4. Exit.
```



Allow the `Student` type to interact with the `FrontDesk` interface and perform simple operations.

Here are the details of the classes that need to be implemented:
Each definition class should have the following components:
1. private fields
2. getters and setters for the private fields
3. constructors (at least 1 or more) to initialize the private fields
4. the toString() method
5. the equals() and the hashCode() method 

1. Book
   1. a field to store the name of the book (String).
   2. a field to store the name of the author of the book (String).
   3. a field to store the 13-digit ISBN number of the book (String).
2. Student
   1. a field to store the name of the student (first name, middle name, last name- all String).
   2. a field to store the university roll number of the student (long).
   3. a field to store the number of books issued by the student (int).
   4. a field to store all the names of the books issued by the student (Book[]).
3. Library
   1. a field to store all the books that are currently available (Book[]).
4. FrontDesk
   1. a field to store the details of the student currently interacting with the system (Student).

Since this is the first assignment, feel free to add as many methods as you can, just remember the naming conventions 
of a field, and a method; the name of a field should be a noun, and the name of a method should be a verb!

It is completely alright if you cannot implement the actual code for the methods, you can simple write a print 
statement to represent that the methods are working, just like in the `Video Rental Inventory System` project.
